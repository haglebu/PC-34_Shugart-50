# PC-34 FDC to Shugart-50 FDD
Floppy disk drive adapter for old 8" drives.

With the adapters presented here you can connect an old 8" floppy disk drive (FDD) with Shugart 50 pin interface to a "modern" IBM compatible floppy disk controller (FDC) with PC 34 pin interface. I have tested them all, they are working!

# Note

*There is also another type of adapter that looks the same at first glance but has a different internal wiring. You need this type if you want to connect a "modern" floppy disk drive (5.25" or 3.5") to an „old“ 50 pin floppy disk controller (like Tandy/Radio Shack; not IBM compatible).
